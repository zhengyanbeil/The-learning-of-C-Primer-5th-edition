# The-learning-of-C-Primer-5th-edition
# As the description of title
I havd borrowed C++ primer(5th edition) from my university library. But it is a pity that I don't have enough power to learn it by myself. Therefore, the creation of this repository is to promote myself to learn C++11.

# The new info
Thank you for attention, This repositoty is privacy for its ownwer and useless for guests. Because these codes only record my process of learning, the meaning of codes is little aimless. Therefore, I will be much happy if you learning something from my codes. Please contact me for discussion.
